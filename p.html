       <center> <h2>abstract</h2></center>
        <h3>In order to monitor the operating status of vehicles, it is necessary to collect vehicle operating data in real time through loT devices. It is difficult to truly realize data processing in real time.In order to ensure that the data is not stolen or tampered with, the PRESENT lightweight encryption algorithm is adopted to ensure the safety of data transmission, to achieve the dynamic key update whichis approximately one-time pad, and greatly improves the security of the data</h3>
