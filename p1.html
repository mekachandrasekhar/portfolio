    <h1>FINGERPRINT BASED CAR IGNITION SYSTEM USING ARDUINO AND RFID</h1>
     <h2>abstract</h2>
    <h3>This effort focuses on keeping autos safe from unwanted usage and preventing theft. Only approved individuals can start the vehicle using a biometric fingerprint security system. This protects the car. The use of security systems is expanding and is becoming increasingly required around the world. Biometrics such as fingerprints are commonly employed in factories, buildings, and schools. This project is concerned with vehicle security, which leads to the development of an anti-theft system in a car using the ATmega328. To detect the fingerprint, an inside-the-vehicle fingerprint sensor is used. The fingerprint sensor data reading obtained in the ATmega328 is analyzed using the pre-assigned data. The engine ignition system starts after recognizing the person as the car owner or an authorized fingerprint user who can take control of the car.</h3>
